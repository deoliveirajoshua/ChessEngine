# About The Project
As a senior at Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science in Worcester, I was tasked with finding a senior project I would have to do for an entire 100 hours by the end of the year. As a result, I decided to have the optimistic idea to build my own chess AI (Artificial Intelligence)! However, it came dawned on my rather quickly (or maybe after 20 hours into coding and banging my head against the wall) that my computer science and general coding skills lacked the depth needed to meet my intended goal. In lieu, I changed the course of the project to instead be a more achievable goal, build my own chess software entirely from scratch. 

As a way to make the code actually usuable to other people that somehow happen to find this page while scrolling through the vast expanse of GitHub and accidentally finding this page, I decided to break up the software into neat, orderly packages instead of the tempting "one class that somehow holds 30,000 lines of pure spaghetti code." Hopefully someone can find them useful down the road...
